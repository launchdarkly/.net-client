LaunchDarkly SDK for .NET
===========================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wjj4xipn4xpniu8c?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jkodumal/net-client)

Quick setup
-----------

0. Use [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console) to add the .NET SDK to your project:

        Install-Package LaunchDarkly.Client

1. Import the LaunchDarkly package:

        using LaunchDarkly.Client;

2. Create a new LDClient with your SDK key:

        LdClient ldClient = new LdClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY");

Your first feature flag
-----------------------

1. Create a new feature flag on your [dashboard](https://app.launchdarkly.com).
2. In your application code, use the feature's key to check whether the flag is on for each user:

        User user = User.WithKey(username);
        bool showFeature = ldClient.toggle("your.feature.key", user, false);
        if (showFeature) {
          // application code to show the feature 
        }
        else {
          // the code to run if the feature is off
        }

Check out our [documentation](http://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/dotnet-sdk-reference).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
