# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly .NET SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [3.6.0] - 2018-02-19
### Added
- New property `LdClient.Version` returns the client's current version number.
- Adds support for a future LaunchDarkly feature, coming soon: semantic version user attributes.
- Custom attributes can now have long integer values.

### Changed
- It is now possible to compute rollouts based on an integer attribute of a user, not just a string attribute.

## [3.5.0] - 2018-01-29
### Added
- Support for specifying [private user attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/private-user-attributes) in order to prevent user attributes from being sent in analytics events back to LaunchDarkly. See the `AllAttributesPrivate` and `PrivateAttributeNames` methods on `Configuration` as well as the `AndPrivateX` methods on `User`.

### Changed
- The stream connection will now restart when a large feature flag update fails repeatedly to ensure that the client is using most recent flag values.
- Client no longer reconnects after detecting an invalidated SDK key.

## [3.4.1] - 2018-01-19
### Added
- Framework target for netstandard1.4 and netstandard2.0. Thanks @nolanblew and @ISkomorokh!
- Added the Apache 2.0 license to `LaunchDarkly.Client.csproj`

### Changed
- Fixed a bug causing ASP.NET applications to be blocked during client initialization.
- Removed unused and transitive dependencies.
- Improved logging. Thanks @MorganVergara and @JeffAshton!

## [3.4.0] - 2017-11-29
### Added
- :rocket: Support for Streaming via [Server-Sent Events](http://html5doctor.com/server-sent-events/) as an alternative to Polling. [HTTP-based streaming](https://launchdarkly.com/performance.html) is favored over polling to reduce network traffic and propagate feature flag updates faster. :rocket:
- New builder parameters to complement streaming functionality
  - `WithIsStreamingEnabled`: Set whether streaming mode should be enabled, `true` by default.
  - `WithStreamUri`: Set the base URL of the LaunchDarkly streaming server. May be used in conjunction with the [LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay).
  - `WithReadTimeout`: The timeout when reading data from the streaming API. Defaults to 5 minutes
  - `WithReconnectTime`: The time to wait before attempting to reconnect to the streaming API. Defaults to 1 second
- Apache 2.0 License

### Changed
- Streaming is now used to retrieve feature flag configurations by default.
- Minimum (and default) polling interval changed from 1 second to 30 seconds.
- `PollingProcessor` no longer retries failed feature flag polling attempts.

## [3.3.2] - 2017-08-30
### Changed
